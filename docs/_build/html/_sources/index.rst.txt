The Light Plate Apparatus (LPA)
===============================
.. image:: device_img.png

The LPA is a general purpose, customizable, user-friendly, open-source instrument for performing optogenetics and other photobiology experiments in batch and adherent cell culture systems.
Using the LPA, each well of a 24-well plate can be independently exposed to variable intensity, millisecond time-scale signals from one or two LEDs.
